## Part 2: Practical Experiments

### Experiment 1: Frida Installation on Android Emulator

1. **Download Frida Server**
   - Obtain the Frida server zip file from GitHub.

2. **Move Files Using ADB**
   - Transfer the unzipped files to the Android emulator using ADB commands.

3. **Setup ADB Shell**
   - Ensure root privileges are enabled on the emulator/device.

4. **Start Frida Server**
   - Change necessary permissions and start the server to enable dynamic instrumentation.

*Outcome*: Frida successfully injected scripts into running processes on the emulator, enabling traffic capture and behavior modification in real time.

### Experiment 2: Lab Experiment Using MobSF

1. **Install MobSF Virtual Machine**
   - Set up the MobSF VM environment with proper network configurations.

2. **Connect Android Emulator**
   - Use ADB commands to connect the emulator to MobSF's environment.

3. **Transfer Lab APK Files**
   - Move test APK files to the emulator using ADB and install them manually.

4. **Proxy Configuration**
   - Configure Burp Suite as a proxy to capture traffic between the app and server.

5. **Account Setup Testing**
   - Reset accounts in the lab application and analyze network traffic using Burp Suite logs.

*Outcome*: MobSF successfully identified vulnerabilities in the lab APK during static/dynamic analysis while Burp Suite captured network traffic for further insights.
